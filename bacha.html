        <h1>#BachaShutdown</h1>
        <p1>We'll be straightforward on this one. The youth is tired of being sidelined in their own country. We shall be heard. We have simple demands:
            <ul>
                <li>The declaration and treatment of youth unemployment as a national emergency.</li>
                <li>The formation of a Youth Representative council and the implementation of the National Youth Policy.</li>
                <li>Reform of NMDS to allow the average graduate to pursue Masters and/or a business or get employment.</li>
                <li>The implementation of mobile courts to try suspects of Gender Based Violence.</li>
            </ul>

            We shall publish articles on each of these four points as an elaboration, and post updates on the movement. Links shall be made available to relevant articles on this page.
        </p1>
        <p>#BachaShutdown is a movement for and by the youth of Lesotho. TLI, along with other NGOs, supports the movement, but neither do we nor the other organisations own it. TLI did, however, found the movement, and is closely following its progress.
            Hence, we are eager to communicate issues about the movement with the public, and shall do so even on this website in the form of articles.
