                <h3>Shadow Cabinet</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para">
                <p>The Shadow Cabinet is the sum of registered members of the Transform Lesotho Initiative. Members have the right to vote on the leadreship and the decisions of the organisation, and may take on an array of responsibilities for the organisation,
                    without it hampering their personal or professional lives. Members are also to take part in annual meetings, and may attend most other meetings throughout the year. The Shadow Cabinet is also the pool out of which every 5 years the
                    governing body shall be chosen, with each member eligible only once to become President. We can go a long way with a large enough Shadow Cabinet with members from different communities and of varying skills to help push TLI forward
                    and to make a difference in those communities. All Basotho between the ages of 16 and 34 are eligible, and a fee of M20.00 is required to register as a member. Please email us with the subject "Membership Application," stating where
                    you live, your motivations for joining, and providing your phone number. We shall contact you when members in your area are being registered.

                <h3>Volunteers</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para">
                <p>We hope to one day have the funding necessary to hire staff, but currently a lot of the work in the organisation is done by volunteers. If you have a skill that might be of help to get the organisation started, please do not hesitate to
                    contact us. Regarding this website, we'd appreciate the help of photographers and web developpers, for example. We could also use professional advise and critique in areas where there is room for improvement. Public figures lending
                    their voice to our efforts can also help us greatly.

            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    Freelancers may contact us if they would like to contribute in any of our causes for a wage. Some tasks do require a lot of time and effort that a volunteer may not consacrate, and freelancers are invaluable in this area.

            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    We look forward to parnering and sharing resources with other organisations. These may also contact us, as we shall reach out to them as well. Together we are stronger.

                <h3>Donors</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para">
                <p>Our current funding is from members and a few donors. Funding is critical to some of the developments we would like to make in the organisation. Our current activities are also limited by this variable. We hope to have more donors in the
                    future who share TLI's vision.</p>
                <p>These are the ways the running of the organisation can be helped greatly. It is all for nothing without the engagemant of fellow Basotho in our initiatives, hence the effort of the average Mosotho, young or old, member or not, is the key
                    to reaching the common goal that we all share: the creation of a greater Lesotho. Please help us in anyway you can.</p>
