            <p>Transform Lesotho Initiative is an organisation formed by members of the youth, and open for anyone between the ages of 16 and 34 to join. TLI is also more than willing to collaborate with other organisations that have the best interests of
                Lesotho at heart. TLI encourages the youth of Lesotho to hold the government accountable, and is thus supportive of movements such as #BachaShutdown. Being a relatively new organisation, TLI hopes to gain the support of its fellow citizens
                in its efforts to make a positive difference.

        <h3>Who Aren't We?</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>TLI is NOT a politically affiliated body. While the change TLI pushes for is political, TLI has no working relationship with any political parties, in or outside of Lesotho. We are uninterested in what political parties our members support,
                and regard this aspect of their lives as being personal. TLI is NOT officially registered, but has been working towards this. We expect to be registered soon. TLI is also NOT a militant group in the sense that we admonish violence. We
                believe in peaceful means of protest and communication; we do not excuse violence, regardless of the intentions of those exercising it. TLI is NOT what it does not explicitly state it is. Some articles on this website, if need ever be,
                shall address questions and claims about what it is and is not. This About page may also be subject to updating.
            </p>

        <h3>Where Are We?</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>Our activity is based in Lesotho, but we do not yet have any offices. For correspondence with us, please see our <a href="{{url_for('contact')}}">Contact</a> page. We hope to have a reach that extends to all ten districts, and among our goals
                this has a high priority.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>We seek to empower the youth and make their voices heard. The programmes we shall implement to achieve this merit articles of their own, which we shall link below, as soon as they are available. TLI also seeks to achieve these ends by partaking
                in programmes led by other organisations with similar aspirations.
            </p>
